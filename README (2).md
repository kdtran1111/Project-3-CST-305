Install numpy, matplotlib and jupyter notebook if not already have them

Open the program in jupyter notebook
 
The program is to solve and plot the ODEs result for:
1. 𝑦"+4𝑦=𝑥;𝑦(0)=𝑦′(0)=0

2. 𝑦"+𝑦=4; 𝑦(0)=𝑦′(0)=0

Run the program on Jupyter notebook


After executing, the graph will show and the execution time will be printed.
